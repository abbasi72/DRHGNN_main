Here, we present DRHGNN, a Drug Repurposing method based on Hypergraph Neural Network for predicting drug-disease association in three stages. Firstly, it constructs a heterogeneous graph that contains drug and disease nodes and links between them; in the second stage, it converts the heterogeneous simple graph to a hypergraph with only disease nodes. This is achieved by grouping diseases that use a same drug into a Hyper-edge. Indeed, all the diseases that are the common therapeutic goal of a drug are placed on a Hyper-edge. Finally, graph neural network is used to predict drug-disease association based on the structure of the hypergraph. Experimental results shows that the used hypergraph-based approach effectively captures complex interrelationships between drugs and diseases, leading to improve accuracy of drug-disease associations prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods
